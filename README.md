# IPL-PLAYERS-SALARY-PREDICTION

The purpose of this project is to developed models that can help to find talented teams 
with minimum possible spending amount for a players. In this project, we build several 
predictive models for predicting the salary of a player in the Indian Premier League, a cricket 
league, based on each playerâ€™s past performance. The models are developed using TREE 
based model. The best-performing model in the study is based on the validation data 
misclassification rate. The selected model provides us with the probability measure of the 
each player. The Indian Premier League (IPL), sports league was contested during the month 
of April and May on every year by the teams representing the Indian cities. The models that 
are developed can help decision makers during auction set salaries for the players
